# Recurrent Neural Networks

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Sample data (replace this with your preprocessed dataset)
# X_train and y_train should be numpy arrays with appropriate shapes
X_train = np.random.randn(
    100, 10, 1
)  # Sample input data with shape (samples, timesteps, features)
y_train = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=(100,))  # Sample target data (length of stay)

# Define the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(Dense(units=1))  # Output layer with one neuron for regression task

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mean_squared_error")

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Once trained, you can use the model for predictions
# Assuming X_test contains your test data with the same shape as X_train
# Replace X_test with your actual test data
X_test = np.random.randn(
    10, 10, 1
)  # Sample test data with shape (samples, timesteps, features)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Print predicted length of stay
print(predictions)
